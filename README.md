# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts customer churn using advanced machine learning models, enabling businesses to implement **targeted retention strategies** and reduce customer loss.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical business challenge. By predicting which customers are likely to leave, companies can proactively engage them with tailored interventions. This project:

- Explores customer demographics, subscriptions, usage patterns, and payments
- Compares multiple machine learning models for churn prediction
- Identifies high-risk customers and their profiles
- Provides actionable retention strategies based on predictive insights

## Key Insights

- **Gradient Boosting model** achieved the best performance with ~79.5% accuracy and balanced precision-recall metrics.
- **Tenure, monthly charges, and contract type** were key churn predictors.
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts with high monthly charges** showed higher churn risk.
- **Electronic check payments** correlated with higher churn rates.

## Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost  
- **Platform:** Google Colab

## Files

- **customer-churn-prediction.ipynb:** Google Colab notebook containing full code, model training, evaluation, and risk predictions.
- **Customer_Churn_Prediction_Report.pdf:** Comprehensive business report summarising methodology, model results, high-risk customer profiles, and retention strategies.

## Data Source
